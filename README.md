This project analyzes Supermarket Sales Data using Power BI for the years 2019–2020.
The goal is to identify key sales trends, best-performing product categories, regional behavior, and profit insights through an interactive dashboard.

This fulfills Task 1: Business Sales Dashboard for the Future Interns Data Science & Analytics Internship.

✔ Sales and Profit KPIs
✔ Category, Subcategory & Segment analysis
✔ Region-wise & State-wise performance
